## What is in the presentation?

In the presentation I demo Jupytext and show how you can use it to
- represent a Jupyter notebook as a script,
- reversely, open a Python, R, Bash, etc script in the form of a Jupyter notebook,
- refactor a notebook represented as a script, and update the original notebook,
- combine multiple contributions to a notebook.

## Demo material

The repository also contains:
- The [source files](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext_pyparis_2018/tree/master/slides) for the presentation.
- The [demo script and material](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext_pyparis_2018/tree/master/demo). Use our binder to run the demo step-by-step:
